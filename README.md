# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to work alongside the Disaster Reporting Network in order to create a dynamic and interactive map on earthquakes from around the world. We want to make these earthquake maps informative and easy to use.

## Resources Used
- Data: United States Geological Survey
- Tools: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, D3 library, Leaflet Library, Mapbox

## Results
As we can see from the map below, we were able to accomplish quite a few things. The first being circle markers to indicate where the earthquakes have occured. The size of the marker is dependent on the size of the magnitude, and from the key in the bottom right-hand corner, we can see how the color of the markers also correlate with the size of the magnitude. The red line going across the map indicated where the tectonic plates are. In the upper right-hand corner, there are other filters that we can apply to the map. We can see how the earthquakes look on a satellite-street map and on a dark map. We can choose to only show the earthquake data, the tectonic plate data, or even just show the major earthquakes that have occured. The map we have created here is interactive and quite easy to use and navigate.
